    The concept I chose and worked on for this final began with pointer to make dynamic arrays but
I ended up using vectors to make dynamic arrays work. A dynamic array is an array that will allocate
storage as its needed throughout the program , this means dynamic arrays save of memory and are more
efficient.

    The example I decided to use is a grading program that can be expanded to accommodate more students
or assignments. Dynamic arrays can be used in most programs that require user input to store large amounts
of the same type of data.

    If there is any kind of roster or database that needs to expand to hold more users then a dynamic array
would be the best thing to use. This could be applied to scheduling programs for a company that can handle
large amounts of employees or this could work for taxis and buses to keep track of payments from customers.

    The benefit of using this over just allocating a large block of memory is if a device can't handle having
too much space used at one time or if the developer does not know how large a database has to be in their program.
