        review: good program but it has no error trapping.

        Purpose :
          Error Trapping
          Input when Input is not needed
          no global variables
        Overtime ://calculate the hours worked overtime //calculating the gross //getting the pay per hour from the job number
          40hr normal pay
          40 to 60 time and a half
          60+ double over 60 time and a half
        Input :
          Employee Name (first and last)
          Job Number
          Hours worked (this week)

        Job #
        10 -- 8.75
        20 -- 12.25
        30 -- 13.75

        Functions
          2+ functions
          Function serves a purpose
          Prototypes
          Documentation

        General
          Multiple employees
          output pay (broken down by general , OT , and total)
          formatting and organizing output

        Above / Beyond
          Keep track of employees on text file
          Table of output
          For each employee output as a check
          Error Trapping
