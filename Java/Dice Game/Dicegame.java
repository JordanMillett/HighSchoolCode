	When you place this game you roll 3 dice and it acts like a slot machine, 
	if you roll 3 of the same you get your bet back times the amount your rolled. 
	if you roll a 1 anywhere you get an additional $10.
	
	What I Learned :
	How to use two class files together
	How to create my own methods
	How to use a return statement
	
	What I Need To Do :
	I need to do a large amount of error trapping
	I would like to optimize parts of my code and add different rewards
